# Weather App 

This fully functional weather app has been cerated with HTML, CSS and JavaScript 
using an API.

It uses the OpenWeatherMap API to display the weather of any city that the user enter in the search bar.

The app also uses a second API [Unsplash] to display the city that you're searching in the background.

## Demo

The project has been deployed on GitHub Pages and can be launched inside a browser.
